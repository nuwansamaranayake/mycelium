"""contracts.md is enforced, not aspirational (Doctrine Rule 6).

The table is derived from the served OpenAPI schema, never from the router source: router
decorators are pre-prefix declarations, so the source shows paths a client cannot call.
Enforcement is literal — path parameter spellings included — because a normalised
comparison lets parameter names drift while staying green. Four assertions:
every implemented row is served exactly, every served operation has an implemented row, every
planned row is NOT served yet (so implementing a route forces its row to flip), and nothing
marked out-of-schema leaks into the schema.
